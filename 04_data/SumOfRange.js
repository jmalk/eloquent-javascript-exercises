/* 
 * Eloquent JavaScript, Chapter 4 Ex 1
 *
 * Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns
 * an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
 * Next write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum
 * of these numbers. Run `console.log(sum(range(1, 10))); and see if it returns
 * 55.
 *
 * Extra credit: modify range function to take a `step` value which defaults to
 * 1.
